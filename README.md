# Monster Valle
> Monster Valle, full-featured MMORPG based in PokÃ©mon made with JavaScript, NodeJS, PhaserJS, VueJS and websockets. 
> After years I turn that project code open and free to everyone.
> The current situation is that I want to rewrite the older release to new one with a better architecture.

You can see notables mechanics here: https://ivopc.github.io/monster-valle/gallery.html#video

Notable features: PvP, Players Market Place, Quests, multiplayer real-time interactions, monster move learning and level up, party, items, storyline and etc.

In a good creative solution, a "script language" was build on top of JSON to automate the gameclient/gameserver, most part of the game is full automated: level design, UIs, battle, network proccesses; personal architecture pattern was created to make the development and maintainability easy and clear. Edit UI in Photoshop and send it directly to game in real-time. 
It have a lot to say about my skills as an engineer and architect, because I've created creative solutions that saved a lot of mounths of manual working. A lot of optimizing in game loading, of couse, because I am in a web platform that resources cannot be loaded at once, a lot of creative solutions involving dynamic load.
